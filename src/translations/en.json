    "history": {
      "paragraph1": "My interest in creating software solutions started all the way back in secondary school. I built an application for a shop system using Microsoft Access as part of a project. Seeing the interface and experience change through modifying a few lines of code was fascinating to me. I went on to study Mathematics at University but took as many Computer Science modules as possible. I built my first Java application, a hangman game, and used C++ to learn about parallel processing and image processing. I had a really exciting final year project working with the Welsh Rugby Union modelling line-out strategies using game theory, Monte Carlo simulation and Python.",
      "paragraph2": "Fresh from university, I started my career as a C++ developer at a gambling games company creating virtual casino games. I created a roulette game that saw a total value played increase of 700% when compared to the average game. I moved in to a lead position in a newly created online development team within the company and that’s where my interest in web development began. The more I explored the rich ecosystem of web technologies, the more I realised this was the path for me. I was offered a new role at a consultancy firm and led the development of a virtual engagement product that allowed mandatory public consultations to continue throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, culminating in an internal award for digital product of the year."
